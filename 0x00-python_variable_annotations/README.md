#Python Variable Annotations 

This is a Python project designed to introduce and explore the concept of type hints. Type hints are optional annotations added to Python code to specify the expected data types of variables, functions, and methods. This practice enhances code readability, maintainability, and helps catch potential type-related errors during development.

# Overview
This project focuses on understanding and implementing unit and integration tests in Python. Unit tests verify individual units of code (e.g., functions, classes), while integration tests ensure that different components of a system work together as expected.

## Objectives
- Learn the concepts of unit and integration testing.
- Write effective unit tests using the unittest module.
- Create integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of a system.
- Understand the importance of testing in software development.
